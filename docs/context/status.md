# Status (current state and next step only)
Last updated: 2026-11-10.

## Where we are
Phase 1 merged (PR #1, #2): one `opsdesk.jar` (Angular + Spring Boot), catalog + incident API on PostgreSQL, 41 TestNG/Mockito/Testcontainers tests, 2 Vitest tests. History note: the branch history was rewritten on 2026-11-10 to remove a committed local DB password; `main` still has the old phase-1 plan text naming it.
Phase 2 merged (PR #3): JaCoCo + Vitest coverage, SonarCloud, `Dockerfile` (UBI JRE, UID 1001/GID 0, random-UID + read-only verified), compose profile `app`, `tools/smoke-test.sh`, `ci.yml` + reusable `maven-verify.yml` (gitleaks, Trivy fs/image with SARIF, smoke test, GHCR publish gated by `PUBLISH_IMAGE`), Dependabot, pre-commit gitleaks.

Phase 3 merged (PR #7): probes + graceful shutdown; Helm chart (restricted SCC, Route/Ingress, NetworkPolicies, values schema, 25 helm-unittest tests, kubeconform, Trivy via `trivy.yaml`), dev PostgreSQL (sclorg) with in-cluster password, prod values (mock), `tools/kind-verify.sh` (passed locally), CI jobs `helm` and `deploy-dev` (OpenShift, off until `OPENSHIFT_DEPLOY=true`).

## Next up
1. Phase 4 `feature/observability`: plan `docs/plans/2026-11-10-phase-4-observability.md` (owner review pending). Owner decision: local Elastic stack as compose profile.
2. Dependabot PRs #4 (maven patch), #6 (jsdom major): merge when green; #5 (TypeScript 7): close (Angular 22 needs TS 6); phase 4 adds an ignore rule.
